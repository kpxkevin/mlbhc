						It was a sensational day at the plate for <a href="../players/player_431.html">Aaron Wright</a> as he led the charge to a 17-5 win over the Phillies. The <a href="../teams/team_10.html">Chicago</a> center fielder was pure misery for the <a href="../teams/team_5.html">Philadelphia</a> pitching staff. He left them shell-shocked with 5 hits in 6 at-bats in an explosive display of hitting. <br><br>"<a href="../players/player_431.html">Wright</a> put the ball into play and he really hit it hard," said Rocket Can, manager for the Phillies, after the game. "When you do that, you've got a good chance to do some damage. And that's what happened. I feel like we threw some good pitches, but he just put some good swings on the ball." <br><br><a href="../players/player_431.html">Aaron Wright</a> hit a solo-shot off <a href="../players/player_259.html">Cruz Martinez</a> in the 1st, hit a three-run double in the 2nd, grounded out in the 5th, singled in the 6th, hit an RBI single in the 7th and singled in the 9th.<br><br>For the year <a href="../players/player_431.html">Wright</a> has hit at a .358 clip with 36 RBIs, 7 home runs and 20 runs scored.<br><br><a href="../box_scores/game_box_181.html">View Boxscore</a><br><a href="../game_logs/log_181.html">View Game Log</a><br><Watch Highlights:highlight#181>
