						In an announcement today, the league informed <a href="../players/player_475.html">Armando Berduo</a> of <a href="../teams/team_3.html">San Diego</a> and <a href="../players/player_131.html">Jim Dutcher</a> of <a href="../teams/team_12.html">Baltimore</a> that they both had been suspended 2 games for fighting in a recent game.<br><br>The league president told them, "This type of aggressive behavior will not be tolerated in this league."<br><br><a href="../players/player_475.html">Berduo</a> wasn't happy with the length of his suspension. He thought he got the worst deal and told the league commissioner, "In any fight, whoever throws the first punch should get a more severe penalty. If I threw the first punch, I'd expect to get the most punishment. Whoever took the blow should get a lesser punishment."<br><br>His manager agreed with him and said something needs to be done about it. "<a href="../players/player_475.html">Berduo</a> is right. The league needs to look at its policy and make sure the punishment fits the crime."<br><br>So far this season <a href="../players/player_475.html">Berduo</a> has no home runs and a .361 batting average. <br><br>For the year <a href="../players/player_131.html">Dutcher</a> has 1 save. In 7 relief appearances he has hurled 10 innings, fanned 8 and issued 7 walks with a 1-0 record. The <a href="../teams/team_12.html">Baltimore</a> reliever has recorded a 6.30 ERA and allowed the opposition to hit .229 when he is on the hill.
