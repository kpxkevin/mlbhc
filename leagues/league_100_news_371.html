						Why is Saverio Tirado suddenly so popular around his hometown? Might it have something to do with his series of TV and radio commercials for a local car dealership that has taken the city by storm?<br><br>Viewers can't seem to pin down what exactly it is about the Tampa Bay player that is so endearing, but Tirado now has a cult following around town.<br><br>"I've never sold cars in my life. To be perfectly honest, they probably just wanted a team member that fit their price range," Tirado said with a hearty laugh. "I've always been that kind of guy, and I thought it was something fun to do with some free time. I'm big on supporting local businesses, too."
