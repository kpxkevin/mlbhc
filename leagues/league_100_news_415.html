						It was a sensational day at the plate for <a href="../players/player_522.html">Alex Ledesma</a> as he led the charge to a 7-3 win over the Giants. The <a href="../teams/team_9.html">Tampa Bay</a> left fielder was pure misery for the <a href="../teams/team_4.html">San Francisco</a> pitching staff. He left them shell-shocked with 5 hits in 5 at-bats in an explosive display of hitting. <br><br>"<a href="../players/player_522.html">Ledesma</a> put the ball into play and he really hit it hard," said Jamar Quan, manager for the Giants, after the game. "When you do that, you've got a good chance to do some damage. And that's what happened. I feel like we threw some good pitches, but he just put some good swings on the ball." <br><br><a href="../players/player_522.html">Alex Ledesma</a> singled in the 2nd, singled in the 4th, hit an RBI single in the 5th, doubled in the 8th and singled in the 9th.<br><br>This season in 53 games, <a href="../players/player_522.html">Ledesma</a> has hit at a .341 clip with 72 hits, 10 home runs, 44 RBIs and 39 runs scored.<br><br><a href="../box_scores/game_box_317.html">View Boxscore</a><br><a href="../game_logs/log_317.html">View Game Log</a><br><Watch Highlights:highlight#317>
