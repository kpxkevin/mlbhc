						The <a href="../teams/team_4.html">San Francisco Giants</a> were not very happy with the home plate umpire in today's loss to <a href="../teams/team_2.html">Colorado</a> at AT&T Park. One in particular -- <a href="../players/player_285.html">Jose Martinez</a>. Upon being called out on strikes, the Giants first baseman gave the ump quite an earful. For that, the man in blue gave him the thumb and sent him to an early shower.<br><br>But the disgruntled Martinez lingered on the field for another five minutes, berating the umpire. Finally his manager got him off the field and into the clubhouse.<br><br>But it got worse after the game, when Martinez told reporters, "He was blind today. They played 'Three Blind Mice' for him. If he doesn't know the words to the song, I'm sure we can get it in Braille, so he can follow along."<br><br>For his escapades and after-the-game oration, the league office suspended Martinez for 3 games.<br><br>So far this season <a href="../players/player_285.html">Martinez</a> has hit .329 with 7 home runs, 18 RBIs and scored 16 times.
